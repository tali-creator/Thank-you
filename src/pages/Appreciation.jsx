            Good morning, ma üòä <br />
            I hope work is going well and that you‚Äôre doing great! <br /> First
            of all, I want to take a moment to truly appreciate everything
            you‚Äôve done for me. Thank you so much for all your support and for
            everything you‚Äôve done for the community as a whole. You‚Äôve been an
            incredible person probably the best thing that has happened to me
            this year. Words aren‚Äôt enough to express how grateful I am. If
            there were something greater than ‚Äúthank you,‚Äù I‚Äôd definitely use
            it! Once again, thank you so much for everything, ma.

            At the beginning of this year, I set a goal for myself, to outline
            the things I wanted to achieve in my tech journey. However, I lacked
            the means and resources to accomplish them. But, as fate would have
            it, I met you, and everything began to change. I‚Äôve been able to do
            things I once thought were beyond my reach. I‚Äôve visited places I
            never imagined I would at this stage. I‚Äôve participated in
            activities I believed were far off in my journey. I‚Äôve met people I
            never dreamed of meeting at this point in my life all because of
            you. I am incredibly grateful for everything you‚Äôve done to support
            me. You‚Äôve truly made a remarkable impact on my life.

          How My Tech Journey has Been
        </h1>
        <p className="md:text-xl flex flex-col space-y-2 px-10 text-start font-serif">
          <span>
            I started my tech journey years ago, but life had its challenges,
            and I found myself struggling with many other responsibilities.
            Things didn‚Äôt go as planned, and I had to work hard just to meet
            basic needs. Without any support from anywhere, my progress was
            significantly slowed. Growing up, I‚Äôve always had to work through
            challenges on my own. I‚Äôm not used to relying on others or having
            someone step in to help. So when you extended your care and support
            not just to me but to others as well it truly melted my heart. I
            can‚Äôt fully express how much it means to me, but I alone know how
            deeply grateful I am.
          </span>
          <span>
            I began my tech journey in 2020, inspired by a friend who was
            excelling in the tech space. However, I lacked mentorship,
            resources, direction, or funds to enroll in a tech hub like CoLab. I
            started by using the desktop we had at home to learn HTML and CSS,
            then moved on to basics of PHP, Python, JavaScript, Cybersecurity,
            and Bootstrap. Without a mentor to guide me, I ended up learning
            whatever came to mind. Unfortunately, this chaotic approach only
            left me more confused, as I wasn‚Äôt following a structured learning
            process.
          </span>
          <span>
            Back then, I didn‚Äôt even have a usable phone to access the internet.
            I‚Äôd borrow a friend‚Äôs 4G phone whenever they visited, buy a small
            amount of airtime, and download PDFs or video tutorials from YouTube
            to learn. I‚Äôve always had a passion for tech, but sadly, I didn‚Äôt
            have the resources to nurture it.
          </span>
          <span>
            I remember in 2015/2016, just after writing my JSCE, my elder
            brother, who is a soldier, wanted to enroll me in a tech hub to
            learn a skill. He took me to Dialogue Computer Institute, where I
            bought a form and selected web development as my course. However, my
            dad, being very traditional, refused to let me go, insisting I
            should wait until after secondary school. That opportunity passed me
            by, and when my dad passed away in 2017, life became even tougher.
          </span>
          <span>
            My elder brother, now married and with a family of his own, had to
            bear the responsibility of caring for everyone. As a soldier with a
            modest income, he couldn‚Äôt spare much for me.
          </span>
          <span>
            To buy my first laptop, I worked as a security guard for months to
            save enough money. Unfortunately, after just 2‚Äì3 months, the laptop
            was stolen, forcing me to start all over again. I eventually saved
            up to buy another one, which later got spoiled. I told you about
            that one the one I repaired and sold to add to the money I had. You
            completed the rest for me, and that‚Äôs how I got the laptop I‚Äôm using
            now üòä.
          </span>
          <span>
            One of my greatest regrets (though not entirely a mistake) was
            enrolling in university without being fully prepared or financially
            capable. I‚Äôve had to struggle daily to cover my school fees and
            upkeep. I‚Äôve done everything legal and within my ability to make
            money. Looking back, I feel I could have used those resources to
            push my tech career first and then pursued school later when I was
            more stable. Now, the resources I have aren‚Äôt enough to support both
            school and my tech journey. Plus, school consumes so much of my
            time.
          </span>
          <span>
            The only time I can practice coding comfortably is at night. I‚Äôve
            committed to dedicating at least three hours every night to studying
            and improving my coding skills. Despite the challenges, I‚Äôm
            determined to keep moving forward in my tech journey.
          </span>
          <span>
            I wish I could dedicate 100% of my time to practicing. I strongly
            believe that if I could, I would have progressed much further by
            now. However, I still have to take on petty jobs to cater to my
            needs. With school resuming soon, I‚Äôll also need to save up money
            for my school fees, which will act as additional obstacles.
            Nevertheless, I want to reassure you that your investment in me will
            never go to waste. I‚Äôve promised you that, and I intend to keep my
            promise. I will continue to work hard and ensure I never disappoint
            you, ma.

          Progress I've Made so Far
        </h1>
        <p className="md:text-xl flex flex-col space-y-2 px-10 text-start font-serif">
          <span>
            Looking back at my progress so far, I can confidently say that I‚Äôm
            doing far better ever since you enrolled me in the Full Stack
            Development course and the Fitech Bootcamp we recently concluded.
            With proper dedication and consistent practice, I‚Äôve learned a lot.
            Previously, I struggled with learning JavaScript mainly due to a
            lack of concentration. I was constantly moving from one thing to
            another, working hard to sort things out. This inconsistency caused
            me to forget what I‚Äôd learned because, as you know, coding requires
            regular practice. When you step away from it for too long, it feels
            unfamiliar when you return. Now, however, I can proudly say there‚Äôs
            been a significant improvement. The Fitech Bootcamp, in particular,
            made a huge impact. I‚Äôve been able to understand concepts in
            JavaScript that I previously found difficult. I‚Äôm not yet a pro, but
            I now have a solid grasp of the basics enough to confidently advance
            to the next language or framework.
          </span>
          <span>
            Over the Past 4 Months, I‚Äôve Learned: <br />
            JavaScript <br />
            SCSS <br />
            React/Next.js <br />
            Tailwindcss <br />
            Git <br />
            Learning React for the first time, I can confidently say that I
            didn‚Äôt find it as challenging as it‚Äôs often portrayed to be or maybe
            I just haven‚Äôt encountered the more complex aspects yet. For now, I
            can boldly say I‚Äôm doing well with it. I‚Äôm eager to practice React
            in real-time and become more fluent with it. I‚Äôve built a few
            projects using React and JavaScript, and I‚Äôll share their links
            below for you to check out. These are basic projects for a beginner,
            so I wouldn‚Äôt say they‚Äôre entirely reliable. I‚Äôm still in the
            learning phase, but I hope to create something much more advanced
            and impactful as I continue to grow.
          </span>

          <span>
            I‚Äôm yet to focus my attention on Web3 üòî. This is because I‚Äôm still
            trying to master and gain a clearer understanding of React and
            JavaScript. I don‚Äôt want to rush the process, as I believe a strong
            foundation is essential. Hopefully, by next year, I‚Äôll be ready to
            channel all my energy toward Web3 and dive into the "main deal." For
            now, I‚Äôm taking things step by step to ensure I truly grasp the
            concepts I‚Äôm currently working on.

              One of the most basic challenges I face is the lack of full
              attention, as my day is often split with other activities to earn
              a little income.
            </li>
            <li>
              Electricity supply where I live is very poor it‚Äôs really bad. We
              mostly get power late at night, but it‚Äôs fine with me because
              that‚Äôs when I‚Äôm usually free to practice my coding.
            </li>
            <li>
              I would have mentioned data issues, but you've already taken care
              of that. The biweekly stipends you provide have been a huge help.
              Ma, you don't know how much that has made a difference. I
              understand how hard I have to work to earn that amount, but you‚Äôve
              made my life so much easier with your support. Because of that, I
              can afford to take days off from hustling, go to CoLab (apart from
              the days I have class there), and use their facilities for
              learning. That alone has played a big part in my progress.
            </li>
            <li>
              I'm not from a well to do family. I grew up in a place where
              everyone had to hustle for themselves. My dad passed away in 2017
              (St. Gerard Catholic Hospital, Kaduna). I haven't finished my
              secondary school at that time. Not that he was financially able to
              support us much (may his soul rest in peace), but his presence
              alone would have made a difference. My mom is hearing impaired.
              She wasn‚Äôt born that way she lost her hearing in 2011 due to a
              surgery. As a result, she can‚Äôt do much anymore. She used to be a
              very strong and hardworking woman, but her condition has affected
              her greatly. Currently, she lives with my elder sister, who is
              married and lives far in the south (Oyo State). I live alone here
              in Kaduna.{" "}

              I‚Äôve always wished my mom was closer so I could tell her about you

              unfortunately, she‚Äôs not nearby.

            I know I haven‚Äôt been updating you about my progress lately, and I‚Äôm
            sorry if that reflects poorly on me. I truly apologize for not
            communicating more frequently, ma.
          </span>
          <span>
            The issue is that I‚Äôm not very good at communicating with people,

            ‚Äúhigher‚Äù than me. Many times, I‚Äôve opened your DM to send a message,

            sending greetings over and over because I fear it might get tiresome

            There was also a time I wanted to call you, as I mentioned before,
            but couldn‚Äôt make it. I was caught in a situation where I had to
            decide whether to quit my job or not, i needed advice and i found
            you to be the perfect person to advice me. I was working at a bar,
            mostly at night, but when I started the Full Stack class and Fitech
            Bootcamp, there wasn‚Äôt enough time for school, CoLab, work, and
            still practice my coding at night.
          </span>
          <span>
            In the end, I decided to quit the job and dedicate my time fully to
            the Full Stack class and Fitech Bootcamp. It‚Äôs been tough, and the
            decision has affected me greatly, but I guess it‚Äôs a sacrifice I had
            to make.
          </span>
          <span>
            I don‚Äôt often share my struggles with others because I believe
            people judge you based on what they know about you. Unfortunately,
            it‚Äôs usually the negative side that people focus on. I‚Äôd rather work
            hard to protect my dignity than expose my challenges and risk being
            looked down upon.
          </span>
          <span>
            By telling you all of this, I‚Äôm showing you how much trust I‚Äôve
            placed in you. You‚Äôve earned something no one else has ever earned
            from me. I don‚Äôt usually share my story with anyone, but I felt
            comfortable opening up to you. I am deeply grateful for everything
            you‚Äôve done for me. I don‚Äôt often receive this kind of favor, and
            I‚Äôm truly thankful. May God bless you for all the support you‚Äôve
            given me.
